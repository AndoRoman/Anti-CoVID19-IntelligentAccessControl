ANTI-CoVID19 Intelligent Access Control

Grade Project PUCMM 2020

This project will develop an intelligent access control system focused on supermarkets and shops, for the protection and prevention of Covid-19, through the use of 
artificial intelligence, sensors and Raspberry Pi, in order to evaluate whether each person who wishes to access these buildings, has or not a mask, if they have a 
normal body temperature and keeping the number of people allowed inside the premises. The system will have a web application for quick and easy management. In addition, 
it will be implemented in a cloud environment, so that access to it is fast and efficient from any location. This application will present a user-friendly environment 
and maintains a flat configuration area, so that its use is affordable to any type of user. This development effort will be carried out to make the access control that 
exists today in the supermarkets and shops of the world more efficient. Due to the necessary and mandatory Covid-19 prevention measures that must be implemented in these 
commercial sectors. The Anti-Covid19 Intelligent Access Control (ACIAC) will provide an automated, modern and more efficient solution than traditional control 
methodologies. This will allow a better flow of incoming and outgoing customers, as well as provide a better image of modernization and quality to the company.
